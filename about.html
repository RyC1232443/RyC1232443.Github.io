      <h3> About Us </h3>
      <p> <p><span class="fun">Bubble Under</span>
        is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the south-west UK who meet up
        for diving trips in the summer months when the weather is good and the
        bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut
        the costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone gets a
        trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
      <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on our own turf:
        past diving weekends away have included trips up to Scapa Flow in
        Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck sites.</p>
      <p>And when we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk
        about our recent adventures (<em>any</em> excuse, eh?).</p>
      <p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean <em>is</em> followed by a pint or
          two of Old Speckled Hen. You can quote me on that!"</p>
      </blockquote>
